Fleaspy.dev is a simple webpage for viewing Escape From Tarkov item values at a glance.

As a newer player, knowing what to keep and what to throw out (especially on scav raids) was annoying. I found myself constantly searching items just to see the values. So I created Fleaspy.dev.

 - Item price is displayed as the per slot price, them the full price in parenthesis (if the item is larger than one slot).
 - You can set a minimum value cutoff to only see items above a vertain price, makes it a bit less overwhelming.
 - Item prices are not always 100% correct, especially for partially used items or items that don't to a high volume on the flea market.
 - Also I don't account for stacking ammo yet. Maybe in the future?

It uses the tarkov.dev API to get information about the items.
